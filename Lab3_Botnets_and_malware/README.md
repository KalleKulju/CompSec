Computer Security Lab 3: From innocent document file into part of botnet 
====



## Preliminary tasks

It is recommended to read at least following articles in some level to get familiar about topic.

### For first and second task

What are [macros in Office documents, why they could pose a thread?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/macro-malware)

How about [PDF files?](https://www.decalage.info/file_formats_security/pdf)

Take a look for [SANS DFIR short guide](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/media/analyzing-malicious-document-files.pdf) for analysing malicious documents. We are using some of the tools.


### For third task these could give some insight about the purpose ofd

[What is a DDoS attack?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/)

[Botnets?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-botnet/)

We will be using dotnet decompiler to see how malware works on source code level.

### For the last task:

Blog post about malware analysis [in here.](https://medium.com/@dunstconsulting/the-different-types-of-malware-analysis-c9bfbaa44739)

[What is sandbox?](https://www.quora.com/In-computer-security-what-is-a-sandbox)

If you are not familiar with Wireshark, take brief look in to it. [Here is short tutorial.](https://www.lifewire.com/wireshark-tutorial-4143298)

About memory analysis with Volatility: [here](https://medium.com/@zemelusa/first-steps-to-volatile-memory-analysis-dcbd4d2d56a1) is some good blog post about it. This is automated in the task, but volatility can be used externally as well for taken memory dump. 

## Background

Malicious programs are potential harm for almost every user in the internet. Right at this moment (and in the past), one is especially causing gray hairs for plenty of people; *Emotet* malware.  Finnish National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-FI) just released (8/2020)  [yellow level of warning](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/emotet-malware-actively-spread-finland) about malware; how big is the risk for facing this malware to be at the moment on organizations. Maybe COVID-19 pandemic made botnet operators to give up on their vacation, and they are pushing new variations of the old malware. 

There are many ways for malware to spread. This one is using as one, old but still working tactic where user is involved: email attachments. Innocent looking attachment in the innocent looking email message could contain something what you did not except. The content of the attachment is usually made to be something, what you might be more compelling to open: invoices, receipts, legal documents, and more.

This particular malware is currently known mostly as *information stealer*. It is RAT (Remote Access Trojan) on the computer, and is able to receive almost arbitrary commands for making actions for infected computer.

This exercise is mostly based on something similar. Malicious document file is doing something more in your computer than you thought! *However, files here are not dangerous, but they can be flagged by some anti-virus products. It is recommended to handle them in Linux based operating system!* **With one exception; the malware of final task (WannaCry): it should not be executed in offline environment on old Windows machine!**

 TODO ; static vs dynamic

In the first task, we try to identify whether PDF of Office document file is clean or malicious, and further try to analyze what PDF file is actually doing.

In the second task, we will take a look for *.eml* file (Saved email message), and try to analyze it's attachment. How far we can go?

In the third task, we are analysing something that attachment in previous task attempts to download and install. This executable is part of the real-life incident, which was used to deploy botnet network for performing DDoS attack against official Finnish government websites and other targets. Malware was originally distributed as trojan horse, a Steam Code Generation application which was supposed to give you free steam codes. (What it of course did not do)

In the last task of the exercise, there is possibility to analyze another common malware, *WannaCry* which is infamous ransomware and caused some chaos some years ago. It had worm-like properties by exploiting some vulnerabilities and spreading mostly without user involvement.

(Part of this real-life DDoS incident can be seen in the Lab 6 (Digital Forensics) as well, in [Task 3](../Lab6_Digital_Forensics/README.md#Task-3). In that exercise you can see what kind of traces DDoS attack can leave in log files. You will learn  how to analyze large-sized log file, and made precises analysis from it. )

Grading
---
Make a short step-by-step report (what, why and how) of following tasks, and include possible source codes and the most important command line commands used in those tasks. It's recommended to read all tasks before starting. Actual instruction for what to do, is ***in bold and italics*** on each task.

You are eligible to following grades in this exercise by doing tasks as defined. Great ideas and implementations could compensate some poorly implemented ones.
*Upper grade requires that all previous tasks have been done as well.*

It is estimated, that you are able to do Task 1 and 2 during lab session (4 hours).

Tasks 3 & 4 are more advanced than earlier ones. Implementation will very likely take time outside of lab.

Task|Grade/Level|Description|
----|:---:|-----------|
[Task 1](#task-1--identifying-malicious-documents "Identifying malicious documents") | 1 | Identifying malicious documents
[Task 2](#task-3-malware---static-analysis "Taking a deeper look for suspicious email message") | 4 | Malware: static analysis
[Task 3](#task-4 "Analysis for more complicated samples ") | 5 | Analysis for more complicated samples OR making own analysis tool

Grade 1 can be acquired by doing lecture questionnaires from the corresponding lectures.


Grade 2 (bare minimum from the lab) can be acquired by doing Task  1.

Difficulty on tasks is expected to be raising as you go forward with them.

You should read all of the instructions, that you know what is happening, and what you actually have to do.

*Return completed tasks to your private GitHub repository!
There will be answer template.*

## **Task 1: Identifying malicious documents**

We have a bunch of document files, whereas some of them might be something more than just documents. Without opening them (hopefully), could we identify the malicious ones from the clean ones?

There are various amount of tools for doing that for you, and we are going to try out some them.

**WARNING:** Do not extract the zip files directly in Windows machine. Antivirus might flag and remove them, even though there are not really malicious files. They just look like and include some patterns malicious files could have.

**A) Has it been identified already?**

When we face a suspicious file, what could we do at first? The first thing we can do, is to see *if someone has already wondered the same thing and has done the analysis already!*

Many anti-virus tools and other databases are signature based - they might have exact [signature hash](https://medium.com/@tom_rock/fifty-shades-of-malware-hashing-3783d98df59c) or some other regular pattern database for detecting malware. Someone/something might have submitted the file into these places and classified it.

Some tools/utilities for general analysis; does it exist already?

 * [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) - The biggest Open Source antivirus engine
 * [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) - analyze url, file or search by hashes against many AV engines. CLI is available in [here.](https://github.com/VirusTotal/vt-cli)
 * [Windows Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10) - many times underrated - but has possibly the largest signature based database among all Window running anti-virus engines. Not used here in practice- but should be noted as good one because of that. (Even [scary good at collecting samples](https://medium.com/sensorfu/how-my-application-ran-away-and-called-home-from-redmond-de7af081100d))

We could try to use ClamAV once it is available:

```
clamscan <FILENAME>
```

Or with `cincan-command`:

```
 cincan run cincan/clamav <FILENAME>
```

We could also try to use VirusTotal for seeing if there is some report about some of our file(s). We could use the graphical Web interface for that, or CLI tool. *We should calculate the hash (SHA256) of the file and search based on that at first - in general, uploading is quite permanent thing and then the file is identified by everyone.*

`sha256sum` command can be used for calculating SHA256 hash of the file.

Do we find some malicious files based on these? Even if there are malicious file, why might not they appear there? What is the bad thing on signature based identification?

B) Let's take a deeper look

Tools for analysing PDF files. They attempt to identify some known patters, which usually can be seen in malicious file, and rarely in clean files.

 * [peepdf & sctest](https://github.com/jesparza/peepdf)
 * [pdfid](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools)
 * [jsunpack-n](https://github.com/urule99/jsunpack-n)

One of the PDF files is potentially malicious.


Tools for analysing Microsoft Office documents which are using OLE2 file format. (called also as [Compound File Binary Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format) )

Usually these file ends with file extensions '.doc' or '.xls'

 * [oletools](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools) (set of different tools)
 * [oledump](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/)


A) What is the worst thing you can do with suspicious Microsoft Office document? What is disabled by default, when you open the document?

B) Malicious PDF files are less common. What could be the reason? How they are usually infecting the machine of potential victim?

## Task 2


Email messages are based on [RFC 822 standard](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt).

## **Task 3: Malware - static analysis**


Previously we have performed dynamic analysis for malware: inspecting the behavior of the malware by executing it.

Another way for analysing is to perform static analysis - we are not executing the malware, instead we are looking at the file(s) itself.

At first glance, if we haven't got much experience about reverse engineering, we might be seeing just some .exe files, and have no idea how to start.

But with some correct tools, we might see a lot, *particularly* in this case!

Let's see what basic Linux command *file* has to say:

```shell
$ file SteamCodeGenerator2016.exe
SteamCodeGenerator2016.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows
```

Looks like that we are probably facing .Net assembly.

One good tool for reversing these kind of executables is [dnSpy.](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy), and we are using it as an example in this case. You should download it.

*NOTE: Download release zip of NET Framework 4.7.2  version! Not direct source.*, 

It is portable tool, which is fully working assembly editor on Windows environment.
In Linux, we can use some of the properties of it, like console part.
We can decompile executables with it, which is enough for us.

Example for decompiling in Linux environment.
Go to dnSpy root directory:
```shell
mono dnSpy.Console.exe -o your/output/path path/to/your/malware.exe 
```
You will need to install [mono](https://www.mono-project.com) to your enviroment, if you want repeat it on another Linux than the one we have provided. Make sure, that you have at least Mono version 5. 

You can also use this tool in sandboxed Windows. This enables some more features and GUI usage, but those are not  mandatory.


Once we disassemble these files, we can actually see whole source code as it's written. It might take couple of minutes to decompile, depending on file, so patience is required. The biggest file might take 10 minutes or more.

Files are not protected at all.

This malware was written in Visual Basic (we can see code as C#) and looks like it has been Microsoft Visual Studio project.

**Now, the intention of this task is to write short report what program is actually doing.** Since we can read program mostly in C#, it shouldn't be hard at all. (In most cases malwares are written in C language or protected somehow, and there we might need to read pure machine instructions instead.)

There should be some exactly same things, what we tought there to be, based on dynamic analyis, if we did it right.

You are free to use any tools you want, as long as you are not analysing in your host system in unsafe environment. Even though this malware is not dangerous anymore, it's good to have principles.

**TIP:** In case .resource files (binary type) are provided instead of .resx format, you can convert it into .resx format from command line as:
  
`resgen Resource.resource Resource.resx`

[.Resx files?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2008/ekyft91f(v=vs.90))

>**Answer *at least* to these questions in your report:**

### A) What's the role of SteamCodeGenerator.exe, keycrack.exe and steam-dll-pro.exe?

### B) How are they trying to hide their current/upcoming activites?

### C) What's the role of anti-cheat-bypass-tool.exe in Data folder?

* We are particularly interested about this file.
* This file contains actually two additional binaries. (These files have been encoded to .resx file somehow) What are their names?
* **Find a way** to reverse these files as well, and include the general purposes of these files as well to your report. Additionally:
  * How bots were controlled? There were at least two ways, describe at least the automatic approach.
  * Some source code or ideas of some common DDoS tools have been used in this malware. Describe three of them. It's enough to identify tools, you can look information about them elsewhere.
  * Malware actually contains hidden GUI for DDoS tools it is using. Can you find and use it? Describe how you did it.


## Task 3:

One of the required skills of analyst or digital forensics guy is to get your analysis environment up and running. Sometimes this might take more time than analysis itself.


* Ever heard about WannaCry malware? In two years ago (2017), this malware caused a lot of troubles in hospitals and other organisations. This malware was ransomware attack, and encrypted all the important files of machine. It exploited some vulnerabilities, which gave it self-spreading properties, making it a *worm*. Luckily there was a flaw (or intended property), which was so called *kill switch*, and stopped the spreading of malware in the cases, when machine was able to connect internet. Every time when malware was executed, it looked for some domain. Based on result malware did something. 
**In this task, we will take of look for original [*dropper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropper_(malware)) of WannaCry. Only this specific dropper contained so called kill-switch.**

    * **Your task is to make static analysis for this dropper, and make step-by-step report, how you can find location of domain name of kill-switch. It should not be too hard, since you know that it exists. Explain this function, which contains kill switch.**

    * Explanation contains how you found the URL and therefore the function. What is the logic of this function? How kill-switch worked?
    What other functions are called in this function? Are functions from other library?
    
    * You can use (and it is recommended to use) for example [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2) for reverse engineering this executable. In practice, we are disassembling binary to machine instructions, and looking the code of malware in assembly language.
    Radare2 will be used in future as well.

    * Cheatsheet for Radare2 can be found [here.](https://github.com/radare/radare2/blob/master/doc/intro.md)

    * If you have no idea how to start, you can run this malware in sandbox as well, and get URL from there. This is not necessary. *But you can do it anyway, if you want to see, what this malware is doing for machine in practice.*

    *  **Some tips**: Can you find this URL, just by looking from *strings* in malware's binary? Further, can you find, where this string is referenced?



* **Something interesting** in botnets or malwares, but we haven't dealt with it yet? Feel free to implement and show us what you got. **Your task has to be approved by assistant before you can start doing it.** Depending on estimated workload, this task could be extendable to final coursework.
